# Cache School Data Application

This is a project for a scheduled task that retrieves the school and department data from the ROO Contacts API 
on a daily basis and caches the data in an S3 json file. At the writing of this README the json file is only 
consumed by the PI Dashboard.

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest
```
